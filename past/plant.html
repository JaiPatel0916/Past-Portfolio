        <article>Neem is a natural herb from the neem tree, other names for which include
            Azadirachta indica and Indian lilac. There are some potential health benefits of neem, but it is also
            possible
            for someone to have a neem allergy or sensitivity.
            The extract comes from the seeds of the tree and has many different traditional uses. Neem is known for its
            pesticidal and insecticidal properties, but people also use it in hair and dental products.
            Margosa is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15–20 metres (49–66 ft), and rarely 35–40 m
            (115–131
            ft). It is evergreen, shedding many of its leaves during the dry winter months. The branches are wide and
            spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of 20–25 m (66–82 ft). The opposite,
            pinnate leaves are 20–40 cm (8–16 in) long, with 20 to 30 medium to dark green leaflets about 3–8 cm
            long.[7]
            The terminal leaflet often is missing. The petioles are short.

            White and fragrant flowers are arranged in more-or-less drooping axillary panicles which are up to 25 cm (10
            in)
            long. The inflorescences, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 250 to 300 flowers. An individual
            flower is 5–6 mmlong and 8–11 mm wide. Protandrous, bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same
            individual tree.

            The fruit is a smooth (glabrous), olive-like drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly
            roundish,
            and when ripe is 14–28 mm by 10–15 mm . The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp
            (mesocarp) is
            yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is 3–5 mm thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of
            the
            fruit encloses one, rarely two, or three, elongated seeds (kernels) having a brown seed coat.

            The margosa treeis similar in appearance to its relative, the chinaberry or bakain, Melia azedarach,[9] with
            which it may be confused. Melia azedarach also has toothed leaflets and similar looking fruit. One
            difference is
            that margosa leaves are pinnate but chinaberry leaves are twice- and thrice-pinnate.

        <p>Neem plant contains flavonoids kemferol, quercetin and myricetin. The trunk bark
            contains nimbin, nimbinin,
            nimbosterol, tannins and a bitter principle margosine.

        <p>The biopesticide produced by extraction from the tree seeds contains limonoid triterpenes.Currently, the
            extraction process has disadvantages such as contamination with fungi and heterogeneity in the content of
            limonoids due to genetic, climatic, and geographical variations.To overcome these problems, production of
            limonoids from plant cell suspension and hairy root cultures in bioreactors has been studied, including the
            development of a two-stage bioreactor process that enhances growth and production of limonoids with cell
            suspension cultures of indica.

        <h2>Ecology</h2>

        <p>
            The margosa tree is noted for its drought resistance. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to
            sub-humid conditions, with an annual rainfall of 400–1,200 mm (16–47 in). It can grow in regions with an
            annual rainfall below 400 mm, but in such cases it depends largely on ground water levels. Margosa can grow
            in many different types of soil, but it thrives best on well drained deep and sandy soils. It is a typical
            tropical to subtropical tree and exists at annual mean temperatures of 21–32 °C (70–90 °F). It can tolerate
            high to very high temperatures and does not tolerate temperature below 5 °C (41 °F). Margosa is one of a
            very few shade-giving trees that thrive in drought-prone areas e.g. the dry coastal, southern districts of
            India and Pakistan. The trees are not at all delicate about water quality and thrive on the merest trickle
            of water, whatever the quality. In India and tropical countries where the Indian diaspora has reached, it is
            very common to see margosa trees used for shade lining streets, around temples, schools and other such
            public buildings or in most people's back yards. In very dry areas the trees are planted on large tracts of
            land.
